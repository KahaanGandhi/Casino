    "We implement a trading strategy that combines momentum and mean reversion to generate trading signals. Let $P_t$ denote the price at time $t$ , $n$ the lookback period, and $\\text{MA}_t$ the moving average over $m$ periods. The momentum at time $t$) is given by $M_t = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t - n}} - 1$, while the mean reversion signal is defined as $MR_t = P_t - \\text{MA}_t$. Trading signals are generated based on these metrics: we buy when $M_t > 0$ and $MR_t < 0$ (indicating positive momentum and a price below the mean) and sell when $M_t < 0$ and $MR_t > 0$ (indicating negative momentum and a price above the mean). Positions are entered based on these signals and exited upon the appearance of an opposite signal."
